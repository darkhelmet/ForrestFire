This project is no longer actively maintained. I might get back to it one 
day. Have updated things for the Go version 1 release.

Very basic access to the postmark API. At the moment it just allows you to 
send a single message at a time. 

Example: 

package main

import (
    "os"
    "github.com/gcmurphy/postmark"
)

func main(){

    msg := &postmark.Message {
                From: "betty@gmail.com",
                To: "bob@hotmail.com",
                Subject: "I IS TEN NINJA'S",
                TextBody: `
                    Dear Bob, 

                    Check out this sweet ninja cat.

                    Sincerely,

                    Betty.`,
            }

    msg.Attach("ninja_cat.jpg")

    pm := postmark.NewPostmark("YOUR_API_KEY")
    rsp, err := pm.Send(msg)
    if err != nil {
        println(err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    println(rsp.String())
}
