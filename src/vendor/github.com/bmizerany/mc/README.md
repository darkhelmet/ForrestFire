# mc.go: A pure Go driver for Memcached (binary protocol, thread-safe)

## Install

		$ goinstall github.com/bmizerany/mc.go

## Use

		import "github.com/bmizerany/mc.go"

		func main() {
			// Error handling omitted for demo
			cn, err := mc.Dial("tcp", "localhost:11211")
			if err != nil {
				...
			}

			// Only PLAIN SASL auth supported right now
			// See: http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/SASLHowto
			err = cn.Auth("foo", "bar")
			if err != nil {
				...
			}
			

			val, cas, err = cn.Get("foo")
			if err != nil {
				...
			}

			exp = 3600 // 2 hours
			err = cn.Set("foo", "bar", cas, exp)
			if err != nil {
				...
			}

			err = cn.Del("foo")
			if err != nil {
				...
			}
		}

## Please Contribute

Not all of the commands are implemented. Only the ones I immedietly needed. Each command is
trival to implement. If you'd like add one, please do so and send a pull request.

The current commands are:

	Get, Set, Del, Incr, Decr

## Performance

Right now the mutex is by far the largest bottleneck. There are thoughts on how to reduce it's impact. Any help is always appreciated.
